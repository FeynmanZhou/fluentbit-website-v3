Every input and output interfaces are implemented through a plugin.When a plugin is loaded, multiple instances of it can be started and in order to instruct the core how to route the records between input and output instances, a tag and a match are required:Input plugin instances are tagged\n\nOutput plugin instances defines a match\n\nWhen a record is buffered it contains a tag, then the router lookup the output instances that have a match for it, then it delivers the data as required.In order to understand more how it works we will introduce some concepts:Input\n\nOutput\n\nEngine\n\nRouting\n\nInputFluent Bit provides different input plugins to gather information from, some of them just collect operating system metrics while others interact with radio devices or listen from specific protocols data.When an input plugin is loaded, an internal instance of it is created. An instance can have it own configuration, the settings available are called properties. Input plugins inherit some fixed properties and also the plugin may expose their own too.OutputSimilar to the input plugins, Fluent Bit provides output plugins which are in charge to deliver the data generated by the inputs to some destination, which can be network service or the file system.When an output plugin is enabled, an internal instance of it is created. This instance is also configurable through it supported properties.EngineThe Engine is the core runtime who schedule to retrieve data from the input plugin or receive notifications from them to collect it. Once it buffers the data, it lookup the destination of the records using the router paths defined at start time, then the records are passed to the right output plugins to deliver the data.RoutingFor Fluent Bit, routing means the action to define paths for the data collected. So for each input plugin instance, exists a configuration property called tag. In the other side the output plugin instances are configured with a property called match, which is a rule to match incoming data under a specific tag pattern."},"getting_started/configuration_schema.html":{"url":"getting_started/configuration_schema.html","title":"Configuration Schema","body":"Configuration SchemaFluent Bit may use optionally a configuration file to define how the service will behave, and before to proceed we need to understand how the configuration schema works. The schema is defined by three concepts:Sections\n\nEntries: Key/Value\n\nIndented Configuration Mode\n\nA simple example of a configuration file is as follows:[SERVICE]\n    # This is a commented line\n    Daemon    off\n    log_level debug\nSectionsA section is defined by a name or title inside brackets. Looking at the example above a Server section have been set using [SERVICE] definition. Section rules:All section content must be indented (4 spaces ideally).\n\nMultiples sections can exists on the same file.\n\nUnder a section is expected to have comments and entries, a section cannot be empty.\n\nAny commented line under a section, must be indented too.\n\nEntries: Key/ValueA section may contain Entries, an entry is defined by a line of text that contains a Key and a Value, using the above example, the [SERVICE] section contains two entries, one is the key Daemon with value off and the other the key Log_Level with the value on. Entries rules:An entry is defined by a key and a value.\n\nA key must be indented.\n\nA key must contain a value which ends in the breakline.\n\nMultiple keys with the same name can exists.\n\nAlso commented lines are set prefixing the # character, those lines are not processed but they must be indented too.Indented Configuration ModeFluent Bit configuration files are based in a strict Indented Mode,  that means that each configuration file must follow the same pattern of alignment from left to right when writing text. By default is suggested an indentation level of four spaces from left to right. Example:[FIRST_SECTION]\n    # This is a commented line\n    Key1  some value\n    Key2  another value\n    # more comments\n\n[SECOND_SECTION]\n    KeyN  3.14\nAs you can see there are two sections with multiple entries and comments, note also that empty lines are allowed and they do not need to be indented."},"getting_started/configuration_file.html":{"url":"getting_started/configuration_file.html","title":"Configuration File","body":"Configuration FileThere are some cases where using the command line to start Fluent Bit is not ideal for some escenarios, when running it as a service a configuration file it&apos;s times better.Fluent Bit allows to use one configuration file which works at a global scope and uses the schema defined previously.The configuration file support three types of sections:Service\n\nInput\n\nOutput\n\nServiceThe Service section defines global properties of the service, the keys available as of this version are described in the following table:\n\nKey\nDescription\nDefault Value\n\nFlush\nSet the flush time in seconds.

Before to digging into the specification is recommended to understand the workflow involved in the runtime.WorkflowFluent Bit runs as a service, meaning that the API exposed for developers provide interfaces to create and manage a context, specify inputs/outputs, set configuration parameters and set routing paths for the event/records. A typical usage of the library involves:Create library instance/context.\n\nEnable input plugin(s) and set properties.\n\nEnable output plugin(s) and set properties.\n\nStart the library runtime.\n\nOptionally ingest records manually.\n\nStop the library runtime.\n\nDestroy library instance/context.\n\nData TypesStarting from Fluent Bit v0.9, there is only one data type exposed by the library, by convention prefixed with flb_.\n\nType\nDescription\n\nflb_ctx_t\nMain library context. It aims to reference the context returned by flb_create();\n\n\nAPI ReferenceLibrary Context CreationAs described earlier, the first step to use the library is to create a context of it, for the purpose the function flb_create() is used.Prototypeflb_ctx_t *flb_create();\nReturn ValueOn success, flb_create() returns the library context; on error, it returns NULL.Usageflb_ctx_t *ctx;\n\nctx = flb_create();\nif (!ctx) {\n    return NULL;\n}\nEnable Input Plugin InstanceWhen built, Fluent Bit library contains a certain number of built-in input plugins. In order to enable an input plugin, the function flb_input() is used to create an instance of it.For plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.Prototypeint flb_input(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the input plugin that is required to enable.The third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.Return ValueOn success, flb_input() returns an integer value &gt;= zero (similar to a file descriptor); on error, it returns NULL.Usageint in_ffd;\n\nin_ffd = flb_input(ctx, &quot;cpu&quot;, NULL);\nSet Input Plugin PropertiesA plugin instance created through flb_input(), may provide some configuration properties. Using the flb_input_set() function is possible to set these properties.Prototypeint flb_input_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int in_ffd, ...);\nReturn ValueOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.UsageThe flb_input_set() allow to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:int ret;\n\nret = flb_input_set(ctx, in_ffd,\n                    &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;my_records&quot;,\n                    &quot;ssl&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,\n                    NULL);\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(). The above example specified the values for the properties tag and ssl, note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.The properties allowed per input plugin are specified on each specific plugin documentation.Enable Output Plugin InstanceWhen built, Fluent Bit library contains a certain number of built-in output plugins. In order to enable an output plugin, the function flb_output() is used to create an instance of it.For plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.Prototypeint flb_output(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the output plugin that is required to enable.The third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.Return ValueOn success, flb_output() returns the output plugin instance; on error, it returns NULL.Usageint out_ffd;\n\nout_ffd = flb_output(ctx, &quot;stdout&quot;, NULL);\nSet Output Plugin PropertiesA plugin instance created through flb_output(), may provide some configuration properties. Using the flb_output_set() function is possible to set these properties.Prototypeint flb_output_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int out_ffd, ...);\nReturn ValueOn success it returns an integer value &gt;= zero (similar to a file descriptor); on error it returns a negative number.UsageThe flb_output_set() allow to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:int ret;\n\nret = flb_output_set(ctx, out_ffd,\n                     &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;my_records&quot;,\n                     &quot;ssl&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,\n                     NULL);\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(). The above example specified the values for the properties tag and ssl, note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.The properties allowed per output plugin are specified on each specific plugin documentation.Start Fluent Bit EngineOnce the library context have been created and the input/output plugin instances are set, the next step is to start the engine. When started, the engine runs inside a new thread (POSIX thread) without blocking the caller application. To start the engine the function flb_start() is used.Prototypeint flb_start(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\nReturn ValueOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.UsageThis simple call only needs as argument ctx which is the reference to the context created at the beginning with flb_create():int ret;\n\nret = flb_start(ctx);\nStop Fluent Bit EngineTo stop a running Fluent Bit engine, we provide the call flb_stop() for that purpose.Prototypeint flb_stop(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\nThe argument ctx is a reference to the context created at the beginnning with flb_create() and previously started with flb_start().When the call is invoked, the engine will wait a maximum of five seconds to flush buffers and release the resources in use. A stopped context can be re-started any time but without any data on it.Return ValueOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.Usageint ret;\n\nret = flb_stop(ctx);\nDestroy Library ContextA library context must be destroyed after is not longer necessary, note that a previous flb_stop() call is mandatory. When destroyed all resources associated are released.Prototypevoid flb_destroy(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\nThe argument ctx is a reference to the context created at the beginnning with flb_create().Return ValueNo return value.Usageflb_destroy(ctx);\nIngest Data ManuallyThere are some cases where the caller application may want to ingest data into Fluent Bit, for this purpose exists the function flb_lib_push().Prototypeint flb_lib_push(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int in_ffd, void *data, size_t len);\nThe first argument is the context created previously through flb_create(). in_ffd is the numeric reference of the input plugin (for this case it should be an input of plugin lib type), data is a reference to the message to be ingested and len the number of bytes to take from it.Return ValueOn success, it returns the number of bytes written; on error it returns -1.UsageFor more details and an example about how to use this function properly please refer to the next section Ingest Records Manually."},"development/ingest_records_manually.html":{"url":"development/ingest_records_manually.html","title":"Ingest Records Manually","body":"Ingest Records ManuallyThere are some cases where Fluent Bit library is used to send records from the caller application to some destination, this process is called manual data ingestion.For this purpose a specific input plugin called lib exists and can be using in conjunction with the flb_lib_push() API function.Data FormatThe lib input plugin expect the data comes in a fixed JSON format as follows:[UNIX_TIMESTAMP, MAP]\nEvery record must be a JSON array that contains at least two entries.
