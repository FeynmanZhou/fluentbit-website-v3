Kubernetes manage a cluster of nodes, so our log agent tool will need to run on every node to collect logs from every POD, for hence Fluent Bit is deployed as a DaemonSet (a POD that runs on every node of the cluster).\nWhen Fluent Bit runs, it will read, parse and filter the logs of every POD and will enrich each entry with the following information (metadata):\n\nPOD Name\nPOD ID\nContainer Name\nContainer ID\nLabels\nAnnotations\n\nTo obtain these information, a built-in filter plugin called kubernetes talks to the Kubernetes API Server to retrieve relevant information such as the pod_id, labels and annotations, other fields such as pod_name, container_id and container_name are retrieved locally from the log file names. All of this is handled automatically, no intervention is required from a configuration aspect.\n\nOur Kubernetes Filter plugin is fully inspired on the Fluentd Kubernetes Metadata Filter written by Jimmi Dyson.\n\nInstallation \nFluent Bit must be deployed as a DaemonSet, so on that way it will be available on every node of your Kubernetes cluster. To get started run the following commands to create the namespace, service account and role setup:\n$ kubectl create namespace logging\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-service-account.yaml\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-role.yaml\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/fluent-bit-role-binding.yaml\nThe next step is to create a ConfigMap that will be used by our Fluent Bit DaemonSet:\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml\nFluent Bit to Elasticsearch\nFluent Bit DaemonSet ready to be used with Elasticsearch on a normal Kubernetes Cluster:\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-ds.yaml\nFluent Bit to Elasticsearch on Minikube\nIf you are using Minikube for testing purposes, use the following alternative DaemonSet manifest:\n$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluent/fluent-bit-kubernetes-logging/master/output/elasticsearch/fluent-bit-ds-minikube.yaml\nDetails\nThe default configuration of Fluent Bit makes sure of the following:\n\nConsume all containers logs from the running Node.\nThe Tail input plugin will not append more than 5MB  into the engine until they are flushed to the Elasticsearch backend. This limit aims to provide a workaround for backpressure scenarios.\nThe Kubernetes filter will enrich the logs with Kubernetes metadata, specifically labels and annotations. The filter only goes to the API Server when it cannot find the cached info, otherwise it uses the cache.\nThe default backend in the configuration is Elasticsearch set by the Elasticsearch Ouput Plugin. It uses the Logstash format to ingest the logs. If you need a different Index and Type, please refer to the plugin option and do your own adjustments.\nThere is an option called Retry_Limit set to False, that means if Fluent Bit cannot flush the records to Elasticsearch it will re-try indefinitely until it succeed.\n\n"},"installation/td-agent-bit.html":{"url":"installation/td-agent-bit.html","title":"TD Agent Bit","body":"TD-Agent Bit\nWe distribute Fluent Bit as packages for specific Enterprise Linux distributions under the name of td-agent-bit.

Implemented through Input Plugins, this interface allows to gather or receive data. E.g: log file content, data over TCP, built-in metrics, etc.\n\n\nParser\nParsers allow to convert unstructured data gathered from the Input interface into a structured one. Parsers are optional and depends on Input plugins.\n\n\nFilter\nThe filtering mechanism allows to alter the data ingested by the Input plugins. Filters are implemented as plugins.\n\n\nBuffer\nBy default, the data ingested by the Input plugins, resides in memory until is routed and delivered to an Output interface.\n\n\nRouting\nData ingested by an Input interface is tagged, that means that a Tag is assigned and this one is used to determinate where the data should be routed based on a match rule.\n\n\nOutput\nAn output defines a destination for the data. Destinations are handled by output plugins. Note that thanks to the Routing interface, the data can be delivered to multiple destinations.\n\n\n\n"},"getting_started/input.html":{"url":"getting_started/input.html","title":"Input","body":"Input\nFluent Bit provides different Input Plugins to gather information from different sources, some of them just collect data from log files while others can gather metrics information from the operating system.

Entries rules:\n\nAn entry is defined by a key and a value.\nA key must be indented.\nA key must contain a value which ends in the breakline.\nMultiple keys with the same name can exists.\n\nAlso commented lines are set prefixing the # character, those lines are not processed but they must be indented too.\nIndented Configuration Mode \nFluent Bit configuration files are based in a strict Indented Mode,  that means that each configuration file must follow the same pattern of alignment from left to right when writing text. By default is suggested an indentation level of four spaces from left to right. Example:\n[FIRST_SECTION]\n    # This is a commented line\n    Key1  some value\n    Key2  another value\n    # more comments\n\n[SECOND_SECTION]\n    KeyN  3.14\n\nAs you can see there are two sections with multiple entries and comments, note also that empty lines are allowed and they do not need to be indented.\n"},"configuration/file.html":{"url":"configuration/file.html","title":"Configuration File","body":"Configuration File\nThere are some cases where using the command line to start Fluent Bit is not ideal for some scenarios, when running it as a service a configuration file it&#39;s times better.\nFluent Bit allows to use one configuration file which works at a global scope and uses the schema defined previously.\nThe configuration file supports four types of sections:\n\nService\nInput\nFilter\nOutput\n\nIn addition there is an additional feature to include external files:\n\nInclude File\n\nService \nThe Service section defines global properties of the service, the keys available as of this version are described in the following table:\n\n\n\nKey\nDescription\nDefault Value\n\n\n\n\nFlush\nSet the flush time in seconds.

The common case is reading from big log files and dispatching the logs to a backend over the network which takes some time to respond, this generate backpressure leading to a high memory consumption in the service.\nIn order to avoid backpressure, Fluent Bit implements a mechanism in the engine that restrict the amount of data than an input plugin can ingest, this is done through the configuration parameter Mem_Buf_Limit.\nMem_Buf_Limit\nThis option is disabled by default and can be applied to all input plugins. Let&#39;s explain it behavior using the following scenario:\n\nMem_Buf_Limit is set to 1MB (one megabyte)\ninput plugin tries to append 700KB\nengine route the data to an output plugin\noutput plugin backend (HTTP Server) is down\nengine scheduler will retry the flush after 10 seconds\ninput plugin tries to append 500KB\n\nAt this exact point, the engine will allow to append those 500KB of data into the engine: in total we have 1.2MB. The options works in a permisive mode before to reach the limit, but the limit is exceeded the following actions are taken:\n\nblock local buffers for the input plugin (cannot append more data)\nnotify the input plugin invoking a pause callback\n\nThe engine will protect it self and will not append more data coming from the input plugin in question; Note that is the plugin responsability to keep their state and take some decisions about what to do on that paused state.\nAfter some seconds if the scheduler was able to flush the initial 700KB of data or it gave up after retrying, that amount memory is released and internally the following actions happens:\n\nUpon data buffer release (700KB), the internal counters get updated\nCounters now are set at 500KB\nSince 500KB is &lt; 1MB it checks the input plugin state\nIf the plugin is paused, it invokes a resume callback\ninput plugin can continue appending more data\n\nAbout pause and resume Callbacks\nEach plugin is independent and not all of them implements the pause and resume callbacks. As said, these callbacks are just a notification mechanism for the plugin.\nThe plugin who implements and keep a good state is the Tail Input plugin. When the pause callback is triggered, it stop their collectors and stop appending data. Upon resume, it re-enable the collectors.\n"},"configuration/memory_usage.html":{"url":"configuration/memory_usage.html","title":"Memory Usage","body":"About Memory Usage\nIn certain scenarios would be ideal to estimate how much memory Fluent Bit could be using, this is very useful for containerized environments where memory limits are a must.\nIn order to estimate we will assume that the input plugins have set the Mem_Buf_Limit option (you can learn more about it in the Backpressure section).\nEstimating\nInput plugins append data independently, so in order to do an estimation a limit should be imposed through the Mem_Buf_Limit option. If the limit was set to 10MB we need to estimate that in the worse case, the output plugin likely could use 20MB.\nFluent Bit has an internal binary representation for the data being processed, but when this data reach an output plugin, this one will likely create their own representation in a new memory buffer for processing. The best example are the InfluxDB and Elasticsearch output plugins, both needs to convert the binary repesentation to their respective-custom JSON formats before to talk to their backend servers.\nSo, if we impose a limit of 10MB for the input plugins and considering the worse case scenario of the output plugin consuming 20MB extra, as a minimum we need (30MB x 1.2) = 36MB.\nGlibc and Memory Fragmentation\nIs well known that in intensive environments where memory allocations happens in the order of magnitude, the default memory allocator provided by Glibc could lead to a high fragmentation, reporting a high memory usage by the service.\nIt&#39;s strongly suggested that in any production environment, Fluent Bit should be built with jemalloc enabled (e.g. -DFLB_JEMALLOC=On).\nJemalloc is an alternative memory allocator that can reduce fragmentation (among others things) resulting in better performance.\nYou can check if Fluent Bit has been built with Jemalloc using the following command:\n$ bin/fluent-bit -h|grep JEMALLOC\nThe output should looks like:\nBuild Flags =  JSMN_PARENT_LINKS JSMN_STRICT FLB_HAVE_TLS FLB_HAVE_SQLDB\nFLB_HAVE_TRACE FLB_HAVE_FLUSH_LIBCO FLB_HAVE_VALGRIND FLB_HAVE_FORK\nFLB_HAVE_PROXY_GO FLB_HAVE_JEMALLOC JEMALLOC_MANGLE FLB_HAVE_REGEX\nFLB_HAVE_C_TLS FLB_HAVE_SETJMP FLB_HAVE_ACCEPT4 FLB_HAVE_INOTIFY\nIf the FLB_JEMALLOC option is listed in Build Flags, everything will be fine.\n"},"input/":{"url":"input/","title":"Input Plugins","body":"Input Plugins\nThe input plugins defines the source from where Fluent Bit can collect data, it can be through a network interface, radio hardware or some built-in metric.

The rounds of allocations are set by Buffer_Chunk_Size. The value must be according to the Unit Size specification.\n32KB\n\n\n\nGetting Started\nIn order to receive Forward messages, you can run the plugin from the command line or through the configuration file:\nCommand Line\nFrom the command line you can let Fluent Bit listen for Forward messages with the following options:\n$ fluent-bit -i forward -o stdout\n\nBy default the service will listen an all interfaces (0.0.0.0) through TCP port 24224, optionally you can change this directly, e.g:\n$ fluent-bit -i forward://192.168.3.2:9090 -o stdout\n\nIn the example the Forward messages will only arrive through network interface under 192.168.3.2 address and TCP Port 9090.\nConfiguration File\nIn your main configuration file append the following Input &amp; Output sections:\n[INPUT]\n    Name        forward\n    Listen      0.0.0.0\n    Port        24224\n    Chunk_Size  32\n    Buffer_Size 64\n\n[OUTPUT]\n    Name   stdout\n    Match  *\n\nTesting\nOnce Fluent Bit is running, you can send some messages using the fluent-cat tool (this tool is provided by Fluentd:\n$ echo &#39;{&quot;key 1&quot;: 123456789, &quot;key 2&quot;: &quot;abcdefg&quot;}&#39; | fluent-cat my_tag\n\nIn Fluent Bit we should see the following output:\n$ bin/fluent-bit -i forward -o stdout\nFluent-Bit v0.9.0\nCopyright (C) Treasure Data\n\n[2016/10/07 21:49:40] [ info] [engine] started\n[2016/10/07 21:49:40] [ info] [in_fw] binding 0.0.0.0:24224\n[0] my_tag: [1475898594, {&quot;key 1&quot;=&gt;123456789, &quot;key 2&quot;=&gt;&quot;abcdefg&quot;}]\n\n"},"input/head.html":{"url":"input/head.html","title":"Head","body":"Head\nThe head input plugin, allows to read events from the head of file.

When a buffer needs to be increased (e.g: very long lines), this value is used to restrict how much the memory buffer can grow. If reading a file exceed this limit, the file is removed from the monitored file list. The value must be according to the Unit Size specification.\nBuffer_Chunk_Size\n\n\nPath\nPattern specifying a specific log files or multiple ones through the use of common wildcards.\n\n\n\nPath_Key\nIf enabled, it appends the name of the monitored file as part of the record. The value assigned becomes the key in the map.\n\n\n\nExclude_Path\nSet one or multiple shell patterns separated by commas to exclude files matching a certain criteria, e.g: exclude_path=*.gz,*.zip\n\n\n\nRefresh_Interval\nThe interval of refreshing the list of watched files. Default is 60 seconds.\n\n\n\nRotate_Wait\nSpecify the number of extra seconds to monitor a file once is rotated in case some pending data is flushed. Default is 5 seconds.\n\n\n\nSkip_Long_Lines\nWhen a monitored file reach it buffer capacity due to a very long line (Buffer_Max_Size), the default behavior is to stop monitoring that file. Skip_Long_Lines alter that behavior and instruct Fluent Bit to skip long lines and continue processing other lines that fits into the buffer size.\nOff\n\n\nDB\nSpecify the database file to keep track of monitored files and offsets.\n\n\n\nDB.Sync\nSet a default synchronization (I/O) method. Values: Extra, Full, Normal, Off. This flag affects how the internal SQLite engine do synchronization to disk, for more details about each option please refer to this section.\nFull\n\n\nMem_Buf_Limit\nSet a limit of memory that Tail plugin can use when appending data to the Engine. If the limit is reach, it will be paused; when the data is flushed it resumes.\n\n\n\nParser\nSpecify the name of a parser to interpret the entry as a structured message.\n\n\nKey\nWhen a message is unstructured (no parser applied), it&#39;s appended as a string under the key name log.

Before to digging into the specification is recommended to understand the workflow involved in the runtime.\nWorkflow\nFluent Bit runs as a service, meaning that the API exposed for developers provide interfaces to create and manage a context, specify inputs/outputs, set configuration parameters and set routing paths for the event/records. A typical usage of the library involves:\n\nCreate library instance/context and set properties.\nEnable input plugin(s) and set properties.\nEnable output plugin(s) and set properties.\nStart the library runtime.\nOptionally ingest records manually.\nStop the library runtime.\nDestroy library instance/context.\n\nData Types\nStarting from Fluent Bit v0.9, there is only one data type exposed by the library, by convention prefixed with flb_.\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nflb_ctx_t\nMain library context. It aims to reference the context returned by flb_create();\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\nLibrary Context Creation\nAs described earlier, the first step to use the library is to create a context of it, for the purpose the function flb_create() is used.\nPrototype\nflb_ctx_t *flb_create();\n\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_create() returns the library context; on error, it returns NULL.\nUsage\nflb_ctx_t *ctx;\n\nctx = flb_create();\nif (!ctx) {\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nSet Service Properties\nUsing the flb_service_set() function is possible to set context properties.\nPrototype\nint flb_service_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, ...);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThe flb_service_set() allows to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_service_set(ctx, &quot;Flush&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, NULL);\n\nThe above example specified the values for the properties Flush , note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.\nEnable Input Plugin Instance\nWhen built, Fluent Bit library contains a certain number of built-in input plugins. In order to enable an input plugin, the function flb_input() is used to create an instance of it.\n\nFor plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.\n\nPrototype\nint flb_input(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the input plugin that is required to enable.\nThe third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_input() returns an integer value &gt;= zero (similar to a file descriptor); on error, it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint in_ffd;\n\nin_ffd = flb_input(ctx, &quot;cpu&quot;, NULL);\n\nSet Input Plugin Properties\nA plugin instance created through flb_input(), may provide some configuration properties. Using the flb_input_set() function is possible to set these properties.\nPrototype\nint flb_input_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int in_ffd, ...);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThe flb_input_set() allows to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_input_set(ctx, in_ffd,\n                    &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;my_records&quot;,\n                    &quot;ssl&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,\n                    NULL);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create().

In order to enable an output plugin, the function flb_output() is used to create an instance of it.\n\nFor plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.\n\nPrototype\nint flb_output(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the output plugin that is required to enable.\nThe third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_output() returns the output plugin instance; on error, it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint out_ffd;\n\nout_ffd = flb_output(ctx, &quot;stdout&quot;, NULL);\n\nSet Output Plugin Properties\nA plugin instance created through flb_output(), may provide some configuration properties.

When started, the engine runs inside a new thread (POSIX thread) without blocking the caller application. To start the engine the function flb_start() is used.\nPrototype\nint flb_start(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThis simple call only needs as argument ctx which is the reference to the context created at the beginning with flb_create():\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_start(ctx);\n\nStop Fluent Bit Engine\nTo stop a running Fluent Bit engine, we provide the call flb_stop() for that purpose.\nPrototype\nint flb_stop(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\n\nThe argument ctx is a reference to the context created at the beginnning with flb_create() and previously started with flb_start().\nWhen the call is invoked, the engine will wait a maximum of five seconds to flush buffers and release the resources in use. A stopped context can be re-started any time but without any data on it.\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_stop(ctx);\n\nDestroy Library Context\nA library context must be destroyed after is not longer necessary, note that a previous flb_stop() call is mandatory.
