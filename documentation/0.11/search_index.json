The common case is reading from big log files and dispatching the logs to a backend over the network which takes some time to respond, this generate backpressure leading to a high memory consumption in the service.\nIn order to avoid backpressure, Fluent Bit implements a mechanism in the engine that restrict the amount of data than an input plugin can ingest, this is done through the configuration parameter Mem_Buf_Limit.\nMem_Buf_Limit\nThis option is disabled by default and can be applied to all input plugins. Let&#39;s explain it behavior using the following scenario:\n\nMem_Buf_Limit is set to 1MB (one megabyte)\ninput plugin tries to append 700KB\nengine route the data to an output plugin\noutput plugin backend (HTTP Server) is down\nengine scheduler will retry the flush after 10 seconds\ninput plugin tries to append 500KB\n\nAt this exact point, the engine will allow to append those 500KB of data into the engine: in total we have 1.2MB. The options works in a permisive mode before to reach the limit, but the limit isexceeded the following actions are taken:\n\nblock local buffers for the input plugin (cannot append more data)\nnotify the input plugin invoking a pause callback\n\nThe engine will protect it self and will not append more data coming from the input plugin in question; Note that is the plugin responsability to keep their state and take some decisions about what to do on that paused state.\nAfter some seconds if the scheduler was able to flush the initial 700KB of data or it gave up after retrying, that amount memory is released and internally the following actions happens:\n\nUpon data buffer release (700KB), the internal counters get updated\nCounters now are set at 500KB\nSince 500KB is &lt; 1MB it check the input plugin state\nIf the plugin is paused, it invoke a resume callback\ninput plugin can continue appending more data\n\nAbout pause and resume Callbacks\nEach plugin is independent and not all of them implements the pause and resume callbacks. As said, these callbacks are just a notification mechanism for the plugin.\nThe plugin who implements and keep a good state is the Tail Input plugin. When the pause callback is triggered, it stop their collectors and stop appending data. Upon resume, it re-enable the collectors.\n"},"configuration/memory_usage.html":{"url":"configuration/memory_usage.html","title":"Memory Usage","body":"About Memory Usage\nIn certain scenarios would be ideal to estimate how much memory Fluent Bit could be using, this is very useful for containerized environments where memory limits are a must.\nIn order to estimate we will assume that the input plugins have set the Mem_Buf_Limit option (you can learn more about it in the Backpressure section).\nEstimating\nInput plugins append data independently, so in order to do an estimation a limit should be imposed through the Mem_Buf_Limit option. If the limit was set to 10MB we need to estimate that in the worse case, the output plugin likely could use 20MB.\nFluent Bit has an internal binary representation for the data being processed, but when this data reach an output plugin, this one will likely create their own representation in a new memory buffer for processing. The best example are the InfluxDB and Elasticsearch output plugins, both needs to convert the binary repesentation to their respective-custom JSON formats before to talk to their backend servers.\nSo, if we impose a limit of 10MB for the input plugins and considering the worse case scenario of the output plugin consuming 20MB extra, as a minimum we need (30MB x 1.2) = 36MB.\nGlibc and Memory Fragmentation\nIs well known that in intensive environments where memory allocations happens in the order of magnitude, the default memory allocator provided by Glibc could lead to a high fragmentation, reporting a high memory usage by the service.\nIt&#39;s strongly suggested that in any production environment, Fluent Bit be build with Jemalloc enabled (-DFLB_JEMALLOC=On), which is an alternative memory allocator that have better strategies to reduce fragmentation among others for better performance.\nYou can check if Fluent Bit have been built with Jemalloc using the following command:\n$ bin/fluent-bit -h|grep JEMALLOC\nThe output should looks like:\nBuild Flags =  JSMN_PARENT_LINKS JSMN_STRICT FLB_HAVE_TLS FLB_HAVE_SQLDB\nFLB_HAVE_TRACE FLB_HAVE_FLUSH_LIBCO FLB_HAVE_VALGRIND FLB_HAVE_FORK\nFLB_HAVE_PROXY_GO FLB_HAVE_JEMALLOC JEMALLOC_MANGLE FLB_HAVE_REGEX\nFLB_HAVE_C_TLS FLB_HAVE_SETJMP FLB_HAVE_ACCEPT4 FLB_HAVE_INOTIFY\nIf the FLB_JEMALLOC option is listed in Build Flags, everything will be fine.\n"},"input/":{"url":"input/","title":"Input Plugins","body":"Input Plugins\nThe input plugins defines the source from where Fluent Bit can collect data, it can be through a network interface, radio hardware or some built-in metric.

The following document describes how to deploy Fluent Bit for your log collection needs.\nConcepts\nBefore to get started is important to understand how Fluent Bit will be deployed. Kubernetes manage a cluster of nodes, so our log agent tool will need to run on every node to collect logs from every POD, for hence Fluent Bit is deployed as a DaemonSet (a POD that runs on every node of the cluster).\nWhen Fluent Bit runs, it will read, parse and filter the logs of every POD and will enrich each entry with the following information (metadata):\n\nPOD Name\nPOD ID\nContainer Name\nContainer ID\nLabels\nAnnotations\n\nTo obtain these information, a built-in filter plugin called kubernetes talks to the Kubernetes API Server to retrieve relevant information such as the pod_id, labels and annotations, other fields such as pod_name, container_id and container_name are retrieved locally from the log file names. All of this is handled automatically, no intervention is required from a configuration aspect.\n\nOur Kubernetes Filter plugin is fully inspired on the Fluentd Kubernetes Metadata Filter written by Jimmi Dyson.\n\nGetting Started\nThe following steps assumes that you have a Kubernetes cluster running with an Elasticsearch database on it. Our default configuration assumes that your database can be reached through the DNS name elasticsearch-logging.\nPlease download the Fluent Bit DaemonSet for Elasticsearch from here:\n\nfluent-bit-daemonset-elasticsearch.yaml\n\nNow your master node deploy the daemonset with:\n$ kubectl apply -f ./fluent-bit-daemonset-elasticsearch.yaml\nAfter a few seconds Fluent Bit will be running and ingesting your logs into your Elasticsearch database. If you database have a different DNS name than elasticsearch-logging, make sure to perform the proper adjustments to the Yaml file.\n"},"development/":{"url":"development/","title":"Fluent Bit for Developers","body":"Fluent Bit for Developers\nFluent Bit has been designed and built to be used not only as a standalone tool, it can also be embedded in your C or C++ applications.

Before to digging into the specification is recommended to understand the workflow involved in the runtime.\nWorkflow\nFluent Bit runs as a service, meaning that the API exposed for developers provide interfaces to create and manage a context, specify inputs/outputs, set configuration parameters and set routing paths for the event/records. A typical usage of the library involves:\n\nCreate library instance/context and set properties.\nEnable input plugin(s) and set properties.\nEnable output plugin(s) and set properties.\nStart the library runtime.\nOptionally ingest records manually.\nStop the library runtime.\nDestroy library instance/context.\n\nData Types\nStarting from Fluent Bit v0.9, there is only one data type exposed by the library, by convention prefixed with flb_.\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nflb_ctx_t\nMain library context. It aims to reference the context returned by flb_create();\n\n\n\nAPI Reference\nLibrary Context Creation\nAs described earlier, the first step to use the library is to create a context of it, for the purpose the function flb_create() is used.\nPrototype\nflb_ctx_t *flb_create();\n\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_create() returns the library context; on error, it returns NULL.\nUsage\nflb_ctx_t *ctx;\n\nctx = flb_create();\nif (!ctx) {\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nSet Service Properties\nUsing the flb_service_set() function is possible to set context properties.\nPrototype\nint flb_service_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, ...);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThe flb_service_set() allows to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_service_set(ctx, &quot;Flush&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, NULL);\n\nThe above example specified the values for the properties Flush , note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.\nEnable Input Plugin Instance\nWhen built, Fluent Bit library contains a certain number of built-in input plugins. In order to enable an input plugin, the function flb_input() is used to create an instance of it.\n\nFor plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.\n\nPrototype\nint flb_input(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the input plugin that is required to enable.\nThe third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_input() returns an integer value &gt;= zero (similar to a file descriptor); on error, it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint in_ffd;\n\nin_ffd = flb_input(ctx, &quot;cpu&quot;, NULL);\n\nSet Input Plugin Properties\nA plugin instance created through flb_input(), may provide some configuration properties. Using the flb_input_set() function is possible to set these properties.\nPrototype\nint flb_input_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int in_ffd, ...);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThe flb_input_set() allows to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_input_set(ctx, in_ffd,\n                    &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;my_records&quot;,\n                    &quot;ssl&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,\n                    NULL);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(). The above example specified the values for the properties tag and ssl, note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.\nThe properties allowed per input plugin are specified on each specific plugin documentation.\nEnable Output Plugin Instance\nWhen built, Fluent Bit library contains a certain number of built-in output plugins. In order to enable an output plugin, the function flb_output() is used to create an instance of it.\n\nFor plugins, an instance means a context of the plugin enabled. You can create multiples instances of the same plugin.\n\nPrototype\nint flb_output(flb_ctx_t *ctx, char *name, void *data);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(), then name is the name of the output plugin that is required to enable.\nThe third argument data can be used to pass a custom reference to the plugin instance, this is mostly used by custom or third party plugins, for generic plugins passing NULL is OK.\nReturn Value\nOn success, flb_output() returns the output plugin instance; on error, it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint out_ffd;\n\nout_ffd = flb_output(ctx, &quot;stdout&quot;, NULL);\n\nSet Output Plugin Properties\nA plugin instance created through flb_output(), may provide some configuration properties. Using the flb_output_set() function is possible to set these properties.\nPrototype\nint flb_output_set(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int out_ffd, ...);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns an integer value &gt;= zero (similar to a file descriptor); on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThe flb_output_set() allows to set one or more properties in a key/value string mode, e.g:\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_output_set(ctx, out_ffd,\n                     &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;my_records&quot;,\n                     &quot;ssl&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,\n                     NULL);\n\nThe argument ctx represents the library context created by flb_create(). The above example specified the values for the properties tag and ssl, note that the value is always a string (char *) and once there is no more parameters a NULL argument must be added at the end of the list.\nThe properties allowed per output plugin are specified on each specific plugin documentation.\nStart Fluent Bit Engine\nOnce the library context have been created and the input/output plugin instances are set, the next step is to start the engine. When started, the engine runs inside a new thread (POSIX thread) without blocking the caller application. To start the engine the function flb_start() is used.\nPrototype\nint flb_start(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\n\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nThis simple call only needs as argument ctx which is the reference to the context created at the beginning with flb_create():\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_start(ctx);\n\nStop Fluent Bit Engine\nTo stop a running Fluent Bit engine, we provide the call flb_stop() for that purpose.\nPrototype\nint flb_stop(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\n\nThe argument ctx is a reference to the context created at the beginnning with flb_create() and previously started with flb_start().\nWhen the call is invoked, the engine will wait a maximum of five seconds to flush buffers and release the resources in use. A stopped context can be re-started any time but without any data on it.\nReturn Value\nOn success it returns 0; on error it returns a negative number.\nUsage\nint ret;\n\nret = flb_stop(ctx);\n\nDestroy Library Context\nA library context must be destroyed after is not longer necessary, note that a previous flb_stop() call is mandatory. When destroyed all resources associated are released.\nPrototype\nvoid flb_destroy(flb_ctx_t *ctx);\n\nThe argument ctx is a reference to the context created at the beginnning with flb_create().\nReturn Value\nNo return value.\nUsage\nflb_destroy(ctx);\n\nIngest Data Manually\nThere are some cases where the caller application may want to ingest data into Fluent Bit, for this purpose exists the function flb_lib_push().\nPrototype\nint flb_lib_push(flb_ctx_t *ctx, int in_ffd, void *data, size_t len);\n\nThe first argument is the context created previously through flb_create(). in_ffd is the numeric reference of the input plugin (for this case it should be an input of plugin lib type), data is a reference to the message to be ingested and len the number of bytes to take from it.\nReturn Value\nOn success, it returns the number of bytes written; on error it returns -1.\nUsage\nFor more details and an example about how to use this function properly please refer to the next section Ingest Records Manually.\n"},"development/ingest_records_manually.html":{"url":"development/ingest_records_manually.html","title":"Ingest Records Manually","body":"Ingest Records Manually\nThere are some cases where Fluent Bit library is used to send records from the caller application to some destination, this process is called manual data ingestion.\nFor this purpose a specific input plugin called lib exists and can be using in conjunction with the flb_lib_push() API function.\nData Format\nThe lib input plugin expect the data comes in a fixed JSON format as follows:\n[UNIX_TIMESTAMP, MAP]\nEvery record must be a JSON array that contains at least two entries.
